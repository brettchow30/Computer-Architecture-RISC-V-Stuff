# ECEC-355
Computer Architecture Class- This course will cover the principles of designing microprocessors using solid engineering fundamentals and quantitative cost/performance trade-offs. Topics will cover computer performance from hardware and software perspective, instruction set architectures focusing on RISC-V, arithmetic for computers, processor datapath and control, single cycle microarchitectures, and pipeline architectures. The course will introduce issues in pipeline design and techniques to solve these issues.
